				<h2>Name</h2>
				<p>“Ghibli” was given by Hayao Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli, based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind (قبلي, romanized: ghiblī), the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry".[4][5] It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as ギブリ (Giburi), the Japanese name of the studio is ジブリ.</p>
				<h2>Works</h2>
				<p>While not technically Studio Ghibli films, The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968), Panda! Go Panda! (1972), The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), Jarinko Chie (1981), Gauche the Cellist (1982), Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Mary and the Witch's Flower (2017), and Modest Heroes (2018) are sometimes grouped together with the Studio Ghibli library (particularly with the Ghibli ga Ippai home video collection released by Walt Disney Studios Japan) due to their ties to the studio. Horus and Cagliostro were the feature-length directorial debuts of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki respectively, and were produced by Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment years before the founding of Studio Ghibli. Nausicaä was directed by Miyazaki at Topcraft, a studio which Miyazaki, Takahata and Toshio Suzuki later purchased and renamed Studio Ghibli. As a result, the film has often been rereleased and marketed as a Studio Ghibli movie. The Red Turtle was a collaborative effort by Studio Ghibli with Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit and was branded as a Studio Ghibli release internationally. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics in North and Latin America. Mary and the Witch's Flower and Modest Heroes were produced by Studio Ponoc, a company founded by Studio Ghibli veterans Yoshiaki Nishimura and Hiromasa Yonebayashi following the 2014 restructuring of Ghibli.</p>
